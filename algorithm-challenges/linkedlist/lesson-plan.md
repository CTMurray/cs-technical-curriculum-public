# 🙌 Linked Lists 🙌

#### Objectives

By the end of this session, the student should:

- understand how to pseudocode an array challenge
- be able to code the linked list challenge in an unoptimized manner  
- be able to code linked list challenge in an optimized manner

---

## ⚡️ Overview
You’re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, 
an integer to add to the list and the position at which the integer must be inserted. 
     - Create a new node with the given integer
     - Insert this node at the desired position and 
     - Return the head node
