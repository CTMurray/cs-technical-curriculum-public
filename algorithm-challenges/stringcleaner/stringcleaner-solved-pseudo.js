// You just invested in some optical character recognition software, but you saved on the budget and the software isn't
// that great.

// You quickly realize that the software inserts some unnecessary numerical characters.

// Your job is to write a function that takes these strings as inputs, and cleans out the numeric characters and
// return a string with special characters and spacing all intact.

// For example:
// stringClean('Thi3s looks65 awesom4e!') == 'This looks great!'

// Special characters include: ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,?

// input number params: n>=0 && n<=arr.length

function stringClean(str) {
    // initialize the array that will be returned as the response
    let arr = [];

    // take the input string and loop through it
    for (let i = 0; i < str.lenght; i++) {}

    // while looping push anything that is not a string numerical value to a new array
    // this array can then be joined and returned as the clean string
}
